# This is Adrenaline: a minimal theme for Obsidian, that uses the accent color for customization.
_[Why does it look different now?](#information-about-the-update)_
# What does Adrenaline offer?
+ a [distraction free](#distraction-free), [space efficient](#space-efficient) and [good looking](#colors) workspace
+ a perfect OOBE *(Out-Of-Box-Experience)* without the need to customize anything except your [accent color](#colors)!
+ [extended features](#features), that the default theme does not have
+ support for light and dark mode *(Do I need to mention this?)*

## Distraction free
Adrenaline has everything right there, when you need it:
>*Personally, I dont like the ribbon, as it uses too much space* - **therefore, Adrenaline hides it, until you hover over it** - same with the buttons in your nav bar

no fancy things:
>Obsidian is for productivity, and Adrenaline endorses that - **therefore, it focuses on retaining the default look and feel of Obsidian as much as possible**

## Space efficient
Adrenaline adjusts the spacing between certain elements, resulting in **more text displayed** compared to the default theme

## Colors
colors are hand-picked and adjusted for the best possible user experience - **this is why no further adjustments are needed**

Additionally, they adjust to the accent color

# Information about the update
Our of all themes I created, Adrenaline is by far my most valued one. Therefore, I want it to be as good as it can be. Version 1 had a completely different look, but I wasn't satisfied with it any more. To anyone missing that look, you can head over to my other theme "Marathon" - it is almost a 1:1 copy of the old Adrenaline.

Don't like the new callouts of Marathon? You can change them in the theme.css file (I plan on implementing a style settings option for that) -> On the bottom of theme theme.css file is the old code for the adrenaline callout, wich can be enabled (remeber to delete the old .callout code).
